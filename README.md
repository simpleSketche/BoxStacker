# GraFix

GraFix is a Graph Neural Network based project evolved from AECTech Hackathon 2022. It is a collaborative effort by Omid, Yankun, Mostapha, Yuan-Tung, Mingbo, Sila, Taro, Alireza. The target is to fix 2d floor plan mis-alignment assuming the floor plan as a graph data structure, in which rooms are nodes and adjacencies are edges.

## Synthetic Data Generation
Please generate the synthetic graph dataset, please refer to the provided Grasshopper script using Rhino 7

## Dependencies
To run this project, you would need:
- python 3.7+
- pytorch 1.12.2
- pytorch.geometric 0.8.0
- networkX
